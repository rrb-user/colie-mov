        "Keeping Rajinikanth's charm aside, the film hardly offers anything new or substantial."[209] Bhuvanesh Chandar of The Hindu wrote "Coolie, on paper, must have had the promised potential. It‚Äôs a grounded crime action drama with Rajini moments to keep it going. But if Lokesh‚Äôs previous films ‚Äî like Kaithi, Master, and Vikram ‚Äî say something that it is that a strong emotional core is the necessary ingredient to make a realistically-shot action drama feel real and present, and this core is what is missing in Coolie."[210] NP Jayaraman of Deccan Herald wrote "While some moments, especially Rajinikanth‚Äôs performance, will give audiences goosebumps, the storyline falls flat, making the movie a tedious watch. The star-studded cast, despite their immense presence, fails to do justice to their respective roles. [...] While the first fails to explode, filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj tries to take the movie to new heights in the second half."[211]
